nrf51822-cli
==================

Provides a build system for nrf51822 projects.

Handles
- Compilation
- Flash Programming
- Soft Devices

Heritage
---------

There are several similar projects available such as [this](https://github.com/hlnd/nrf51-pure-gcc-setup), [that](https://github.com/pauloborges/nrf51822-linux-template), and the [other](https://github.com/EarthLord/nrf51Demo). Each has their own merits.

This project aims to be as simple and well documented as possible, for example, the very concise JLink shorthand commands are expanded and [written more naturally](linky).

Requirements
------------

- nRF51 SDK
- S110 SoftDevice
- nRF51822 Evaluation Kit board PCA1001

In each case, there are multiple versions of these available. The code should be easily modifiable to support them.
